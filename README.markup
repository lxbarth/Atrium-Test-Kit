# Open Atrium Test Kit for Hudson

Collection of scripts for testing Open Atrium with Hudson.

rebuild.sh             Rebuilds Open Atrium from dev make file.
install.sh             Installs Open Atrium.
run-simpletests.sh     Runs Open Atrium Drupal simpletests.

## Note

This is very experimental stuff. I'm using this for reviewing automated testing
of Drupal projects with Hudson.
